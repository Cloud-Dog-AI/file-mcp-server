## Current Evidence Model
- The repository keeps execution evidence in repo-local working reports and rerunnable pytest suites.
- Before release, rerun the relevant `QT`, `UT`, `ST`, `IT`, and `AT` tiers against the intended environment overlays.
- This document records the current catalogue rather than claiming a release verdict.

## Standard Commands
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/quality --env tests/env-QT -q
python3 -m pytest tests/unit --env tests/env-UT -q
python3 -m pytest tests/system --env tests/env-ST -q
python3 -m pytest tests/integration --env tests/env-IT -q
python3 -m pytest tests/application --env tests/env-AT -q
```

## Notes
- Top-level test directories present: `__pycache__`, `application`, `integration`, `private`, `quality`, `system`, `unit`.
- Environment overlays and private credentials are intentionally not published in this document set.
